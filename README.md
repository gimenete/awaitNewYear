# awaitNewYear

Example repo for using async/await in Node.js in 2016. More information in the [original article](https://medium.com/@gimenete/await-newyear-learning-es7-734ca587907#.439osr8vb).

- Uses [babel](https://babeljs.io), but only the minimal for supporting async/await
- Includes [sourcemap support](https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support)
- Uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- Uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for configuration
- Uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for functional testing
- Uses [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This example app also uses [pug](https://pugjs.org) and [express](https://expressjs.com), but any other framework can be easily used.
